# Runtime Design

April Runtime exposes:

- `POST /runtime/chat`
- `POST /runtime/stream`
- `POST /runtime/models/load`
- `POST /runtime/models/unload`
- `GET /runtime/models`
- `GET /runtime/health`

Models are loaded only by registered ID from `configs/models.yaml`. Paths are not accepted through public APIs.

States:

- unavailable
- unloaded
- loading
- loaded
- unloading
- error

The fake backend supports deterministic normal and streaming responses. It is the default development and test path and requires no GGUF files.

The llama.cpp backend is optional. It fails with a clear optional dependency error if `llama-cpp-python` is missing or the configured GGUF file is absent. Only `services/april_runtime/llama_cpp_backend.py` imports `llama_cpp`.

The Core API's `/chat/stream` endpoint forwards typed runtime stream events without waiting for a full model response.

Optional real-GGUF integration tests are controlled by `APRIL_TEST_GGUF_PATH`.
When the variable is absent, tests skip without downloading models. When set,
the test should use a small token limit and cover load, generation, streaming,
and unload against the local file only.
